IS-08 is an AMWA NMOS Specification to set channel mapping/selecting/shuffling settings for use with NMOS APIs.

It has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initative.

See [here](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-audio-channel-mapping) for the GitHub repo for this Specification.

See [here](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifcations.

The documenation and API links immediately below, and the links in the page heading, are for the main development branch. Links to [other releases (tags)](tags/) and [other branches](branches/) appear later in the page, or under "VERSIONS..." in the page heading.

Once AMWA has approved a Specification, its documentation and API links will be for the _most recent approved release_ (which may be earlier than what is shown by the default branch on the GitHub repo).
