## Failure Modes

If a client receives a HTTP 500 response code from the API, a failure has occurred. The client should display the content of the response's `error` field to the user if possible, and indicate that the Device may be in a bad state. The client should also refresh the values in the `map/active` and `map/activations` endpoints to ensure it is accurately reflecting the current state of the API.
